# Applied Bayesian Data Analysis 

If you are intrested in my assignments you can check out the jupyter notebook in the Assignment folders
* Sometimes the rendering of them dont seams to work on github. If so download the folder and check it out locally (if you have jupyter) otherwise there is a html copy you can view in your browser.

*Assigment 4 is not in a nootebook but inregular .py scripts
