#Assignment 1 is in reality Assignment 2


**There are two ways to view this Assignment**

1. Look at the jupyter notebook in the .ipynb file. You need to have python 3.7 and jupyter installed to do this. All the code in the notebook is runnable.
2. Look at the .html file which is a copy of the jupyter notebook with all the results. No code is runnable here.

(It seams like that when previewing in github, the jupyter notebooks renders correctly while the html does not)
